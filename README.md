# Numerical-Methods

## Parallel Methods
* Jacobi
* Gauss Jordan
* Guassian Elimination
* LU Decomposition through Gaussian Elimination
* Jacobi with large scale matrices

# Bonus - Serial Methods

* Solve non lineal equations
	* Incremental searches
	* Bisection
	* False Rule
	* Fixed Point
	* Newton
	* Secant
	* Multiple roots
* Solve system of linear equations
	* Jacobi
	* Sparse Matrices

## Prerequisites 
Before explaining how the application works it is necessary to have installed the following tools in the computer:
 
* Python 3.6
* Numpy
* Gtk 3
* Numba 0.33
* CUDA 7.0+
* GPU

## Execution
First of all, to launch the application it is necessary to open the command line and go to Numerical-Methods in project folder, there will be located a executable called “guiNum.py” so you should type:

```
$ python3.6 ./guiNum.py
```
